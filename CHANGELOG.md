### Added

- Core `Backend` interface with `NewWriter`, `NewReader`, `Exists`, `Delete`, `List`, `Close` methods
- `RecordWriter` and `RecordReader` interfaces for streaming record-oriented data
- `ExtendedBackend` interface with `Stat`, `Mkdir`, `Rmdir`, `Copy`, `Move`, and `Features` methods
- `ObjectInfo` interface for file metadata (Size, ModTime, Hash, MimeType)
- Hash support for MD5, SHA1, SHA256, CRC32, and custom hash types
- Features struct for backend capability discovery
- Backend registry with `Register()`, `Open()`, and `Backends()` functions
- File backend (`backend/file`) for local filesystem storage
- Memory backend (`backend/memory`) for in-memory storage and testing
- S3 backend (`backend/s3`) supporting AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Wasabi, and other S3-compatible services
- SFTP backend (`backend/sftp`) for SSH file transfer with password and key authentication
- Channel backend (`backend/channel`) for Go channel-based inter-goroutine communication
- Multi-writer (`multi/writer`) for fan-out to multiple backends (WriteAll, WriteBestEffort, WriteQuorum modes)
- NDJSON format (`format/ndjson`) for newline-delimited JSON record framing
- Gzip compression (`compress/gzip`) wrapper
- Zstandard compression (`compress/zstd`) wrapper
- Sync package with rclone-inspired file synchronization
- `sync.Sync()` for one-way sync with optional delete
- `sync.Copy()` for copying files without deleting extras
- `sync.CopyFile()`, `sync.CopyBetweenPaths()`, `sync.CopyToPath()`, `sync.CopyFromPath()` convenience functions
- `sync.TreeCopy()` for preserving full directory structure
- `sync.Check()` for comparing files between backends
- `sync.Verify()`, `sync.VerifyFile()`, `sync.VerifyChecksum()` for verification
- `sync.VerifyWithDetails()` and `sync.VerifyAndReport()` for detailed verification results
- `sync.VerifyIntegrity()` and `sync.VerifyAllIntegrity()` for file integrity checks
- `sync.Bisync()` for bidirectional sync with conflict resolution (NewerWins, LargerWins, KeepBoth, etc.)
- Filter system (`sync/filter`) with include/exclude patterns, size filters, and age filters
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm for bandwidth control
- Retry with exponential backoff and jitter for failed operations
- Progress callbacks for sync operations
- Dry-run mode for sync operations
- Concurrent transfer support with configurable parallelism
- Structured logging via slog for sync operations
- Helper functions `CopyPath()` and `MovePath()` for cross-backend operations
- `AsExtended()` helper for type-safe ExtendedBackend conversion
